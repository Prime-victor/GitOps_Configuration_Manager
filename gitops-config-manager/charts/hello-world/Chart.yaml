# charts/hello-world/Chart.yaml
# Chart metadata. Every field here is meaningful:
# - 'version' is the chart version — bump this when you change chart structure
# - 'appVersion' is the version of the APPLICATION the chart deploys
#   These two version independently: chart v1.2.0 might deploy appVersion 3.1.0
# - 'type: application' means this chart deploys actual workloads (vs 'library' charts
#   which only contain reusable templates with no deployable resources)
